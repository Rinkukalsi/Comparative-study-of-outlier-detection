- We will emphasize on comparative study of parametric and nonparametric methods on univariate and multivariate data individually.
- Explore two methods for outlier detection: the Z-score method for univariate datasets and the Mahalanobis distance method for multivariate datasets.
- Demonstrate how to implement these methods using Python and popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
- We also provide an example analysis using a real-world dataset of housing prices. 
- Our results show that both methods can effectively identify outliers in the dataset, but the Mahalanobis distance method is particularly useful for multivariate datasets where outliers may be less obvious.
